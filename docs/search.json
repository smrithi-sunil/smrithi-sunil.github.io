    "text": "Hi, I’m Smrithi. I am a neuroscientist and engineer living in Seattle, Washington with my amazing daughter and husband. I grew up in Bangalore, India and moved to the United States for college. I studied Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. I then moved to Boston to pursue a PhD, also in Biomedical Engineering, at Boston University. I am now a Scientist at the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics in Seattle.\nHow does the brain recovery from injury? And how can we use this knowledge to improve people’s lives? These are the questions that drive my research.\nI fell in love with brain research as an undergraduate research assistant in Jeffrey Capadona’s lab at Case Western. I spent my summers and most of my non-class hours in the lab, staining mouse brain slices and counting neurons. I studied how the brain responds to implanted electrodes with the goal of improving the longevity of neural implants. This is when my love-hate relationship with mice began.\nI then entered a PhD program in Biomedical Engineering at Boston University. My thesis work, in David Boas’ lab, focused on understanding the evolution of neurovascular coupling during stroke recovery. I developed and applied multimodal imaging techniques to study the dynamics of blood flow and neural activity in the brain before and after stroke.\nAfter the completion of my PhD, I moved to Seattle to join the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics as a postdoc. As part of the Optical Physiology team in Neural Dynamics, I develop and use imaging techniques to study the dynamics of neuromodulators and neurotransmitters (think dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine) across different brain regions during decision making behaviors in mice.\nOther fun things about me, I enjoy hand-tool woodworking and looking at data on India. I am trying to write more about these things on my blog. I also trained in Indian classical dance (Bharatanatyam) for 12 years."

    "title": "Cutting Boards and Paul Sellers",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Paul Sellers\nI would like to start by introducing our (Gavin and my) woodworking guru, Paul Sellers. Paul Sellers is a woodworker extraordinaire who specializes in hand tools woodworking. Most importantly to us, he is an excellent teacher who has been developing open source video tutorials of a wide range of woodworking projects for over a decade. His passion for passing on traditional woodworking skills and training the next generation of aspiring woodworkers is ever present throughout his tutorials. If that wasn’t enough, his calming lecturing style is a joy to watch on its own. Paul has a personal website, a one stop for his blog, videos, and tutorials. He also has a specific website, Woodworking Masterclasses, with video tutorials for each project, and another website, Common Woodworking, dedicated to providing detailed guides, exercises, and simple projects for developing your hand tool woodworking skills. Additionally, all of his free content can be found on his active YouTube channel.\nSo, my woodworking journey starts with a Paul Sellers tutorial for making cutting boards. It was a great first project that introduced me to some basic cutting and shaping skills. In full Paul fashion, his video tutorial was recorded outside complete with construction and traffic sounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe apartment woodshop\nWhen I started woodworking, we were living in a 1 bedroom apartment in Seattle. We had a den that housed two desks and all our books. This was where we decided to put our little Black & Decker portable workmate to do our woodworking. We had large tarps that we hung over the bookshelves before we started any work to protect the books from sawdust. We had a make shift tool bench made out of long 2x4s balanced on buckets. Not the ideal woodshop but it worked and we loved it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking the cutting board\nI used poplar to make the first cutting board since it is a cheaper wood and, well, this was my first project. I increased the dimensions slightly to make a larger board compared to what Paul makes in his video. Gavin and I like big cutting boards. I was introduced to four tools with this project: 1. coping saw, 2. spokeshave, 3. rasp, and 4. router plane.\nThe coping saw was fairly simple to get a hang of and useful for making curved cuts. The long end of the cutting board includes a handle, so I used the coping saw for the handle end of the board. The trick to getting a symmetric handle is to first cut one side and then use the cut piece to trace an outline for the other side. This produces a symmetric cut on either side of the midline. This piece of advice seemed so new to me at the time, but turns out there is a lot of tracing already cut pieces onto new boards to get exact dimensions and minimize errors.\nThe spokeshave on the other hand has a steep learning curve. It seemed like I was hacking at the wood when Paul looked like he was carving long shavings off the wood. Of course, I shouldn’t really compare myself to him even if I was an expert, but I can’t help it. Working with the spokeshave helped me learn about wood grain direction - how to identify it, how to shave with the grain, and even some tricks to deal with difficult grain.\nThe rasp was used to smooth out parts of the cutting board handle that the spokeshapve was unable to get to. The rasp is really good at removing large uneven cuts in the wood. However, it does leave big rasp marks that need to be sanded down pretty aggressively. The rasp was another tool that works really well if you get a hang of the grain direction. It is much more efficient in taking wood off evenly if you go with the grain, but can be frustrating when rasping against the grain.\nTo add a little touch of our own, we decided to add a groove along the edge of the cutting board. This included a fourth tool - the router plane. The router plane is useful for cutting small grooves of specific depth below the surface of any panel. To keep the router from veering off course we first built a knife wall with a box cutter. This certainly made it easier to follow a straight line and get a uniform groove on all four sides.\nThe final steps, after adding some curve to all the edges, was sanding and finishing. All the sanding was done by hand. I actually don’t mind sanding by hand for these smaller projects. It has a meditative feel to it. Once sanded, the board was finished with Tung oil, which is safe for wood that touches food.\nOnce we finished the first cutting board we made two additional boards with the intention of gifting but also as further practice with the spokeshave in particular.

    "text": "Abstract\nResident microglia and blood-borne macrophages have both been implicated to play a dominant role in mediating the neuroinflammatory response affecting implanted intracortical microelectrodes. However, the distinction between each cell type has not been demonstrated due to a lack of discriminating cellular markers. Understanding the subtle differences of each cell population in mediating neuroinflammation can aid in determining the appropriate therapeutic approaches to improve microelectrode performance. Therefore, the goal of this study is to characterize the role of infiltrating blood-derived cells, specifically macrophages, in mediating neuroinflammation following intracortical microelectrode implantation. Interestingly, we found no correlation between microglia and neuron populations at the microelectrode-tissue interface. On the other hand, blood-borne macrophages consistently dominated the infiltrating cell population following microelectrode implantation. Most importantly, we found a correlation between increased populations of blood-derived cells (including the total macrophage population) and neuron loss at the microelectrode-tissue interface. Specifically, the total macrophage population was greatest at two and sixteen weeks post implantation, at the same time points when we observed the lowest densities of neuronal survival in closest proximity to the implant. Together, our results suggest a dominant role of infiltrating macrophages, and not resident microglia, in mediating neurodegeneration following microelectrode implantation.\nDownload full article"

A translatable animal model that closely mimics the mechanisms of a human stroke is essential in understanding recovery processes as well as developing therapies that improve functional outcomes. We describe a photothrombosis stroke model that is capable of targeting a single distal pial branch of the middle cerebral artery with minimal damage to the surrounding parenchyma in awake head-fixed mice. Mice are implanted with chronic cranial windows above one hemisphere of the brain that allow optical access to study recovery mechanisms for over a month following occlusion. Additionally, we study the effect of laser spot size used for occlusion and demonstrate that a spot size with small axial and lateral resolution has the advantage of minimizing unwanted photodamage while still monitoring macroscopic changes to cerebral blood flow during photothrombosis. We show that temporally guiding illumination using real-time feedback of blood flow dynamics also minimized unwanted photodamage to the vascular network. Finally, through quantifiable behavior deficits and chronic imaging we show that this model can be used to study recovery mechanisms or the effects of therapeutics longitudinally.\nDownload full article"

Single cell gene expression studies have mostly focused on characterization of neuronal cell diversity; however, recent studies have revealed substantial diversity of glial cells, particularly astrocytes. To better understand glial cell types and their roles in neurobiology, we built a new suite of adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based genetic tools to enable genetic access to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These oligodendrocyte and astrocyte enhancer-AAVs are highly specific (usually &gt; 95% cell type specificity) with variable expression levels, and our astrocyte enhancer-AAVs show multiple distinct expression patterns reflecting the spatial distribution of astrocyte cell types. To provide the best glial-specific functional tools, several enhancer-AAVs were: optimized for higher expression levels, shown to be functional and specific in rat and macaque, shown to maintain specific activity in epilepsy where traditional promoters changed activity, and used to drive functional transgenes in astrocytes including Cre recombinase and acetylcholine-responsive sensor iAChSnFR. The astrocyte-specific iAChSnFR revealed a clear reward-dependent acetylcholine response in astrocytes of the nucleus accumbens during reinforcement learning. Together, this collection of glial enhancer-AAVs will enable characterization of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte populations and their roles across species, disease states, and behavioral epochs.\nDownload full article"

    "text": "Abstract\nIschemic stroke leads to a reduction or complete loss of blood supply causing injury to brain tissue, which ultimately leads to behavioral impairment. Optical techniques are widely used to study the structural and functional changes that result as a consequence of ischemic stroke both in the acute and chronic phases of stroke recovery. It is currently a challenge to accurately estimate the spatial extent of the infarct without the use of histological parameters however, and in order to follow recovery mechanisms longitudinally at the mesoscopic scale it is essential to know the spatial extent of the stroke core. In this paper we first establish optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a reliable indicator of the stroke core by analyzing signal attenuation and spatially correlating it with the infarct, determined by staining with triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC). We then introduce spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) as a mesoscopic optical technique that can be used to accurately measure the infarct spatial extent by exploiting changes in optical scattering that occur as a consequence of ischemic stroke. Additionally, we follow the progression of ischemia through the acute and sub-acute phases of stroke recovery using both OCT and SFDI and show a consistently high spatial overlap in estimating infarct location. The use of SFDI in assessing infarct location will allow longitudinal studies targeted at following functional recovery mechanisms on a mesoscopic level without having to sacrifice the mouse acutely.\nDownload full article"

    "text": "Abstract\nSignificance: Genetically encoded calcium ion (Ca2+) indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for monitoring intracellular Ca2+ concentration changes in living cells and model organisms. In particular, GECIs have found particular utility for monitoring the transient increase of Ca2+ concentration that is associated with the neuronal action potential. However, the palette of highly optimized GECIs for imaging of neuronal activity remains relatively limited. Expanding the selection of available GECIs to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities for in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity. In particular, blue-shifted variants of GECIs are expected to have enhanced two-photon brightness, which would facilitate multiphoton microscopy.\nAim: We describe the development and applications of T-GECO1 — a high-performance blue-shifted GECI based on the Clavularia sp.-derived mTFP1.\nApproach: We use protein engineering and extensive directed evolution to develop T-GECO1. We characterize the purified protein and assess its performance in vitro using one-photon excitation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, in vivo using onephoton excitation fiber photometry in mice, and ex vivo using two-photon Ca2+ imaging in hippocampal slices.\nResults: The Ca2+-bound state of T-GECO1 has an excitation peak maximum of 468 nm, an emission peak maximum of 500 nm, an extinction coefficient of 49,300 M−1 cm−1, a quantum yield of 0.83, and two-photon brightness approximately double that of EGFP. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence increase is 15-fold, and the apparent Kd for Ca2+ is 82 nM. With two-photon excitation conditions at 850 nm, T-GECO1 consistently enabled the detection of action potentials with higher signal-to-noise (SNR) than a late generation GCaMP variant.\nConclusions: T-GECO1 is a high-performance blue-shifted GECI that, under two-photon excitation conditions, provides advantages relative to late generation GCaMP variants.\nDownload full article"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nFunctional neuroimaging, which measures hemodynamic responses to brain activity, has great potential for monitoring recovery in stroke patients and guiding rehabilitation during recovery. However, hemodynamic responses after stroke are almost always altered relative to responses in healthy subjects and it is still unclear if these alterations reflect the underlying brain physiology or if the alterations are purely due to vascular injury. In other words, we do not know the effect of stroke on neurovascular coupling and are therefore limited in our ability to use functional neuroimaging to accurately interpret stroke pathophysiology. To address this challenge, we simultaneously captured neural activity, through fluorescence calcium imaging, and hemodynamics, through intrinsic optical signal imaging, during longitudinal stroke recovery. Our data suggest that neurovascular coupling was preserved in the chronic phase of recovery (2 weeks and 4 weeks post-stoke) and resembled pre-stroke neurovascular coupling. This indicates that functional neuroimaging faithfully represents the underlying neural activity in chronic stroke. Further, neurovascular coupling in the sub-acute phase of stroke recovery was predictive of long-term behavioral outcomes. Stroke also resulted in increases in global brain oscillations, which showed distinct patterns between neural activity and hemodynamics. Increased neural excitability in the contralesional hemisphere was associated with increased contralesional intrahemispheric connectivity. Additionally, sub-acute increases in hemodynamic oscillations were associated with improved sensorimotor outcomes. Collectively, these results support the use of hemodynamic measures of brain activity post-stroke for predicting functional and behavioral outcomes.\nDownload full article"

To quantify neurovascular coupling, we modeled spatiotemporal hemodynamics by convolving neural activity and hemodynamic response functions obtained from deconvolution. Hemodynamic response functions from healthy animals were unable to model hemodynamics in the acute phase, suggesting neurovascular uncoupling.

Acute stroke also resulted in increased global brain oscillations, which showed distinct patterns in calcium and hemodynamics, and the increase in contralesional calcium activity was associated with increased functional connectivity.

If you flipped the stool over, you might even notice the point where we decided that the bottom was flat enough and no one would see it anyway. We used a hand brace and a 1-inch auger bit to drill three holes in the seat for the legs. The holes need to be angled out slightly so that the legs splay out a bit. To get the seat round, we first used a saw to cut the corners off, then a chisel to get the rough round shape, then a rasp to get it closer to round, and finally a spokeshave to get it smooth.\n\n\nThe legs\nEach leg was made from a 2x2 piece of Douglas Fir. We first ripped a 2x4 into two 2x2s. At its widest point, the leg is roughly 2 inches in diameter. We first used a plane to get the legs to a rough round shape, 1 inch in diameter at the top and 1.5 inches at the bottom. We then used a spokeshave to get the legs to their final shape. We made a small jig with a 1-inch hole to help us get the legs to the right diameter for the side that goes into the seat. Finally, we used the brace and 1-inch auger bit to drill a hole slightly towards the bottom of the wide middle part of the leg. This is where the stretcher will go. Drilling this hole was a little tricky because the legs are already so narrow. A couple good legs were lost in the process. The tops of the legs are split down to about 1 inch in depth to add a wedge during the assembly process to create a tight fit.\n\n\nThe stretchers\nThe stretchers are also made from 2x2 Douglas Fir. At its widest point, each stretcher is 1.5 inches in diameter. At either end, it tapers down to 1 inch in diameter. We used a plane to get the stretcher to a rough round shape, then a spokeshave to get it to its final shape. One of the stretchers attaches to the middle of the other stretcher. The ends of the stretchers are also split down to about 1 inch in depth to add a wedge during the assembly process.\n\n\nThe assembly\nThe assembly for the stool was tricky as it requires many pieces to fit into each other at the right position and length. We did multiple dry assemblies first to get everything in the right position. We first attached the legs to the stretchers. Then, the legs as one piece was attached to the seat. The ends of the stretchers were glued in place along with a wedge to keep it tight. The legs were then glued into the seat. Three wedges were added to the top of the seat, one for each leg. The extra length of the stretchers and legs were cut off, and the stool was sanded to a smooth finish. We used shellac to finish the stool.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nThis project took a lot longer to complete than expected. Not that we needed to spend a long time working on the stools, but that we made one stool and just left the project on hold for a while. We finally got around to making the second stool months later. I would say Gavin and my efforts on this stool were about 60/40. I generally prefer to work on smaller and finer projects. Although now we have a nice pair of bar stools that we can use at our kitchen island."

    "text": "Most of us are familiar with Hans Rosling and his infamous bubble charts. Rosling and the people at Gapminder brought to the public eye the fact that the world is much better than we think it is and that things have been getting better over time. This idea has also been popularized by many others, including, famously, Steven Pinker.\nAll of this is great! What about in India? I want to understand how India and its states have changed over time. To get started, I picked probably the worst thing in the world - the deaths of children. In this post, I will dive into the data on infant and child mortality in India, specifically focusing on how it has changed over time and across demographic factors. The data for this post is obtained from The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in the Government of India 1. Unlike the census, which aims to collect data from all households, the NFHS survey is conducted in a representative sample of households throughout India.\nThere are too many interesting factors to talk about in one post, so this will be the first of two posts on this topic. In this post, I will focus on overall trends in child mortality rates, urban versus rural trends, mortality rates by sex, and mortality rates by state. In the second post, I will dive into some demographic factors such as the birth size, timing of births, and maternal education.\n(If you make it to the end, there are some cool interactive maps!)"

    "text": "I recently read two very interesting essays. One titled “Energetic Aliens” by Stephen Malina and the other by Michael Nielsen about “Creative Contexts”.\nEnergetic aliens, as Malina defines it, are those rare people who have the capacity to sustain intense focus for long periods of time on cognitively demanding tasks. Malina gives as examples George Church, Paul Erdős, Isaac Asimov, and Elon Musk to name a few. These are all examples of people who seem to be able to not just function on lower-than-average amounts of sleep compared to an average person, but also be extremely focused and much more productive than an average individual over their lifetime.\n[Narrow] Creative contexts, as Nielsen tries not to define it, are things (for lack of a better word) that people attach to, which drive their passion for working on intellectual pursuits. In Nielsen’s own words:\n\n“It’s the emotional and intellectual force driving the work, the thing you return to over and over. People will sometimes describe it as”the idea”, but it’s often both considerably more and less than an idea. And if you get disconnected from it, don’t nurture and stew in it enough, don’t believe in it enough, you start to lose contact with your project.”\n\nA creative context in this sense can come from relatively small things – an email that makes you have a really positive or negative response, an excellent conversation you just had, a really great piece of writing you just read and connected with. It’s that emotional juice that keeps you working on and coming back to a solo intellection project.\nHaving read both pieces within the same week, I wonder if the “Energetic Aliens” are just really good at creating, nurturing, and sustaining their “Creative Contexts”. If we take Elon Musk for example. Would he have the same level of energy and deep focus if he didn’t feel so strongly about making humanity a multiplanetary species? Would Tesla and SpaceX be what they are today if he was slightly less intense about the future of humankind?\nSo, what I’m trying to say is that his deep do-or-die desire to create a bright future for humanity, whether you agree with that future or not, is Elon Musk’s creative context. He can not only maintain this creative context under tremendous stress and pressure, but also use it to be laser focused and succeed in challenging and big intellectual projects.\nNielsen gives the example of Steve Jobs while talking about creative contexts:\n\n“I think this is, in part, what former Apple designer Jony Ive was talking about when he said of Steve Jobs:”he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.” I suspect what Ive is talking about overlaps with, but isn’t exactly the same as, what I’m calling a creative context. But sometimes that fragile, barely formed thought is the seed of a creative context; it becomes the thing that you defend, and attach to, and develop, the core of a work.”\n\nThis is me quoting Nielsen quoting Jony Ive talking about Steve Jobs. I would say Jobs is an energetic alien as well, with his intensity, relentlessness, and reality distortion fields. In Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, he writes about Jobs’ intensity as:\n\n“Jobs’s intensity was also evident in his ability to focus. He would set priorities, aim his laser attention on them, and filter out distractions. If something engaged him–the user interface for the original Macintosh, the design of the iPad and iPhone, getting music companies into the iTunes Store–he was relentless.”\n\nHis passion for perfection was a deeply emotional feeling and his own creative context. This passion drove him and in turn the people around him to do things that seemed impossible.\nI am very intrigued by the idea of creative contexts. I connected with Nielsen’s idea quite strongly having recently been in a wonderful creative context myself for a life changing solo project, and then almost completely lost it a few months later. How do they come about? Once you have one, how do you maintain it and not lose it? How can you create creative contexts for yourself? Whenever I have had sustained streaks of dedicated focus on a solo project, it’s usually driven by an underlying motivating factor that I connect with emotionally. I am not saying I am anywhere close to the energetic alien standards, but I am able to sustain many days to weeks of lower amounts of sleep and maintain a laser focus on my intellectual goal.\nIf you think there is some truth to my premise, that there exists a relationship between creative contexts and energetic aliens, then which way does the arrow point? Are energetic aliens just inherently better at sustaining their creative contexts, or do the right creative contexts create energetic aliens. Perhaps we all have energetic aliens within us, we just need to find the right context and learn how to maintain it. This sounds like “just find what you’re passionate about”, which I think is insufficient and borderline terrible advice. I suspect, as most things are, the links between creative context and energetic aliens are complicated. If it was simple, we would have more energetic aliens walking among us. But, from my own handful of experiences, I would say the right creative contexts are a partial factor in having energetic alien energy."
