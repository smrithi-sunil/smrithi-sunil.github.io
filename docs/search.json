As part of the Optical Physiology team in Neural Dynamics, I develop and use imaging techniques to study the dynamics of neuromodulators and neurotransmitters across different brain regions during decision making behaviors in mice.\nPrior to joining the Allen Institute, I was a PhD student in the lab of David Boas in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Boston University. For my PhD thesis, I used multimodal optical techniques to study the evolution of neurovascular coupling during stroke recovery."
