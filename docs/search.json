    "title": "Cutting Boards and Paul Sellers",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Paul Sellers\nI would like to start by introducing our (Gavin and my) woodworking guru, Paul Sellers. Paul Sellers is a woodworker extraordinaire who specializes in hand tools woodworking. Most importantly to us, he is an excellent teacher who has been developing open source video tutorials of a wide range of woodworking projects for over a decade. His passion for passing on traditional woodworking skills and training the next generation of aspiring woodworkers is ever present throughout his tutorials. If that wasn’t enough, his calming lecturing style is a joy to watch on its own. Paul has a personal website, a one stop for his blog, videos, and tutorials. He also has a specific website, Woodworking Masterclasses, with video tutorials for each project, and another website, Common Woodworking, dedicated to providing detailed guides, exercises, and simple projects for developing your hand tool woodworking skills. Additionally, all of his free content can be found on his active YouTube channel.\nSo, my woodworking journey starts with a Paul Sellers tutorial for making cutting boards. It was a great first project that introduced me to some basic cutting and shaping skills. In full Paul fashion, his video tutorial was recorded outside complete with construction and traffic sounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe apartment woodshop\nWhen I started woodworking, we were living in a 1 bedroom apartment in Seattle. We had a den that housed two desks and all our books. This was where we decided to put our little Black & Decker portable workmate to do our woodworking. We had large tarps that we hung over the bookshelves before we started any work to protect the books from sawdust. We had a make shift tool bench made out of long 2x4s balanced on buckets. Not the ideal woodshop but it worked and we loved it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking the cutting board\nI used poplar to make the first cutting board since it is a cheaper wood and, well, this was my first project. I increased the dimensions slightly to make a larger board compared to what Paul makes in his video. Gavin and I like big cutting boards. I was introduced to four tools with this project: 1. coping saw, 2. spokeshave, 3. rasp, and 4. router plane.\nThe coping saw was fairly simple to get a hang of and useful for making curved cuts. The long end of the cutting board includes a handle, so I used the coping saw for the handle end of the board. The trick to getting a symmetric handle is to first cut one side and then use the cut piece to trace an outline for the other side. This produces a symmetric cut on either side of the midline. This piece of advice seemed so new to me at the time, but turns out there is a lot of tracing already cut pieces onto new boards to get exact dimensions and minimize errors.\nThe spokeshave on the other hand has a steep learning curve. It seemed like I was hacking at the wood when Paul looked like he was carving long shavings off the wood. Of course, I shouldn’t really compare myself to him even if I was an expert, but I can’t help it. Working with the spokeshave helped me learn about wood grain direction - how to identify it, how to shave with the grain, and even some tricks to deal with difficult grain.\nThe rasp was used to smooth out parts of the cutting board handle that the spokeshapve was unable to get to. The rasp is really good at removing large uneven cuts in the wood. However, it does leave big rasp marks that need to be sanded down pretty aggressively. The rasp was another tool that works really well if you get a hang of the grain direction. It is much more efficient in taking wood off evenly if you go with the grain, but can be frustrating when rasping against the grain.\nTo add a little touch of our own, we decided to add a groove along the edge of the cutting board. This included a fourth tool - the router plane. The router plane is useful for cutting small grooves of specific depth below the surface of any panel. To keep the router from veering off course we first built a knife wall with a box cutter. This certainly made it easier to follow a straight line and get a uniform groove on all four sides.\nThe final steps, after adding some curve to all the edges, was sanding and finishing. All the sanding was done by hand. I actually don’t mind sanding by hand for these smaller projects. It has a meditative feel to it. Once sanded, the board was finished with Tung oil, which is safe for wood that touches food.\nOnce we finished the first cutting board we made two additional boards with the intention of gifting but also as further practice with the spokeshave in particular. These boards did not have the additional grooves as they were smaller. The fun part about these boards was that we made them out of cherry wood. We decided to upgrade from poplar and acquired some cherry and maple wood for nicer projects. I loved how the cherry looked after finishing with Tung oil - too bad I didn’t take better pictures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewly minted cutting boards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnife marks after a year of use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nThe cutting boards were made jointly by Gavin and myself."

How healthy are we? How have we changed over time? and What can we learn from the past?\nI wanted to break down that single number on the world map. Welcome to India in Data! This will be a series of posts where I explore data on India and provide my inexperienced insights. I figured I could use data to expand my understanding of India. I love looking at data and using data to learn about the world. As an engineer and neuroscientist, I collect, visualize, analyze, and interpret data on a daily basis. While I will not be collecting any of my own data, I will use the wealth of data that is publicly available and make visualizations that are more accessible than tables in PDF format.

    "text": "Abstract\nResident microglia and blood-borne macrophages have both been implicated to play a dominant role in mediating the neuroinflammatory response affecting implanted intracortical microelectrodes. However, the distinction between each cell type has not been demonstrated due to a lack of discriminating cellular markers. Understanding the subtle differences of each cell population in mediating neuroinflammation can aid in determining the appropriate therapeutic approaches to improve microelectrode performance. Therefore, the goal of this study is to characterize the role of infiltrating blood-derived cells, specifically macrophages, in mediating neuroinflammation following intracortical microelectrode implantation. Interestingly, we found no correlation between microglia and neuron populations at the microelectrode-tissue interface. On the other hand, blood-borne macrophages consistently dominated the infiltrating cell population following microelectrode implantation. Most importantly, we found a correlation between increased populations of blood-derived cells (including the total macrophage population) and neuron loss at the microelectrode-tissue interface. Specifically, the total macrophage population was greatest at two and sixteen weeks post implantation, at the same time points when we observed the lowest densities of neuronal survival in closest proximity to the implant. Together, our results suggest a dominant role of infiltrating macrophages, and not resident microglia, in mediating neurodegeneration following microelectrode implantation.\nDownload full article"

A translatable animal model that closely mimics the mechanisms of a human stroke is essential in understanding recovery processes as well as developing therapies that improve functional outcomes. We describe a photothrombosis stroke model that is capable of targeting a single distal pial branch of the middle cerebral artery with minimal damage to the surrounding parenchyma in awake head-fixed mice. Mice are implanted with chronic cranial windows above one hemisphere of the brain that allow optical access to study recovery mechanisms for over a month following occlusion. Additionally, we study the effect of laser spot size used for occlusion and demonstrate that a spot size with small axial and lateral resolution has the advantage of minimizing unwanted photodamage while still monitoring macroscopic changes to cerebral blood flow during photothrombosis. We show that temporally guiding illumination using real-time feedback of blood flow dynamics also minimized unwanted photodamage to the vascular network. Finally, through quantifiable behavior deficits and chronic imaging we show that this model can be used to study recovery mechanisms or the effects of therapeutics longitudinally.\nDownload full article"

    "text": "Abstract\nProper brain function requires the assembly and function of diverse populations of neurons and glia. Single cell gene expression studies have mostly focused on characterization of neuronal cell diversity; however, recent studies have revealed substantial diversity of glial cells, particularly astrocytes. To better understand glial cell types and their roles in neurobiology, we built a new suite of adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based genetic tools to enable genetic access to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These oligodendrocyte and astrocyte enhancer-AAVs are highly specific (usually &gt; 95% cell type specificity) with variable expression levels, and our astrocyte enhancer-AAVs show multiple distinct expression patterns reflecting the spatial distribution of astrocyte cell types. To provide the best glial-specific functional tools, several enhancer-AAVs were: optimized for higher expression levels, shown to be functional and specific in rat and macaque, shown to maintain specific activity in epilepsy where traditional promoters changed activity, and used to drive functional transgenes in astrocytes including Cre recombinase and acetylcholine-responsive sensor iAChSnFR. The astrocyte-specific iAChSnFR revealed a clear reward-dependent acetylcholine response in astrocytes of the nucleus accumbens during reinforcement learning. Together, this collection of glial enhancer-AAVs will enable characterization of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte populations and their roles across species, disease states, and behavioral epochs.\nDownload full article"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIschemic stroke leads to a reduction or complete loss of blood supply causing injury to brain tissue, which ultimately leads to behavioral impairment. Optical techniques are widely used to study the structural and functional changes that result as a consequence of ischemic stroke both in the acute and chronic phases of stroke recovery. It is currently a challenge to accurately estimate the spatial extent of the infarct without the use of histological parameters however, and in order to follow recovery mechanisms longitudinally at the mesoscopic scale it is essential to know the spatial extent of the stroke core. In this paper we first establish optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a reliable indicator of the stroke core by analyzing signal attenuation and spatially correlating it with the infarct, determined by staining with triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC). We then introduce spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) as a mesoscopic optical technique that can be used to accurately measure the infarct spatial extent by exploiting changes in optical scattering that occur as a consequence of ischemic stroke. Additionally, we follow the progression of ischemia through the acute and sub-acute phases of stroke recovery using both OCT and SFDI and show a consistently high spatial overlap in estimating infarct location. The use of SFDI in assessing infarct location will allow longitudinal studies targeted at following functional recovery mechanisms on a mesoscopic level without having to sacrifice the mouse acutely.\nDownload full article"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nSignificance: Genetically encoded calcium ion (Ca2+) indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for monitoring intracellular Ca2+ concentration changes in living cells and model organisms. In particular, GECIs have found particular utility for monitoring the transient increase of Ca2+ concentration that is associated with the neuronal action potential. However, the palette of highly optimized GECIs for imaging of neuronal activity remains relatively limited. Expanding the selection of available GECIs to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities for in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity. In particular, blue-shifted variants of GECIs are expected to have enhanced two-photon brightness, which would facilitate multiphoton microscopy.\nAim: We describe the development and applications of T-GECO1 — a high-performance blue-shifted GECI based on the Clavularia sp.-derived mTFP1.\nApproach: We use protein engineering and extensive directed evolution to develop T-GECO1. We characterize the purified protein and assess its performance in vitro using one-photon excitation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, in vivo using onephoton excitation fiber photometry in mice, and ex vivo using two-photon Ca2+ imaging in hippocampal slices.\nResults: The Ca2+-bound state of T-GECO1 has an excitation peak maximum of 468 nm, an emission peak maximum of 500 nm, an extinction coefficient of 49,300 M−1 cm−1, a quantum yield of 0.83, and two-photon brightness approximately double that of EGFP. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence increase is 15-fold, and the apparent Kd for Ca2+ is 82 nM. With two-photon excitation conditions at 850 nm, T-GECO1 consistently enabled the detection of action potentials with higher signal-to-noise (SNR) than a late generation GCaMP variant.\nConclusions: T-GECO1 is a high-performance blue-shifted GECI that, under two-photon excitation conditions, provides advantages relative to late generation GCaMP variants.\nDownload full article"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nFunctional neuroimaging, which measures hemodynamic responses to brain activity, has great potential for monitoring recovery in stroke patients and guiding rehabilitation during recovery. However, hemodynamic responses after stroke are almost always altered relative to responses in healthy subjects and it is still unclear if these alterations reflect the underlying brain physiology or if the alterations are purely due to vascular injury. In other words, we do not know the effect of stroke on neurovascular coupling and are therefore limited in our ability to use functional neuroimaging to accurately interpret stroke pathophysiology. To address this challenge, we simultaneously captured neural activity, through fluorescence calcium imaging, and hemodynamics, through intrinsic optical signal imaging, during longitudinal stroke recovery. Our data suggest that neurovascular coupling was preserved in the chronic phase of recovery (2 weeks and 4 weeks post-stoke) and resembled pre-stroke neurovascular coupling. This indicates that functional neuroimaging faithfully represents the underlying neural activity in chronic stroke. Further, neurovascular coupling in the sub-acute phase of stroke recovery was predictive of long-term behavioral outcomes. Stroke also resulted in increases in global brain oscillations, which showed distinct patterns between neural activity and hemodynamics. Increased neural excitability in the contralesional hemisphere was associated with increased contralesional intrahemispheric connectivity. Additionally, sub-acute increases in hemodynamic oscillations were associated with improved sensorimotor outcomes. Collectively, these results support the use of hemodynamic measures of brain activity post-stroke for predicting functional and behavioral outcomes.\nDownload full article"

Additionally, we identified a novel use for spatial frequency domain imaging to quantify the spatial extent of the stroke core.\nFinally, we combined the mouse stroke model and imaging platforms to investigate the effect of stroke on neurovascular coupling. We found that acute stroke led to the abolishment of both calcium and hemodynamic responses to sensory stimulation. This elimination of response was associated with a loss of correlation between calcium and hemodynamic activity in the acute phase. To quantify neurovascular coupling, we modeled spatiotemporal hemodynamics by convolving neural activity and hemodynamic response functions obtained from deconvolution. Hemodynamic response functions from healthy animals were unable to model hemodynamics in the acute phase, suggesting neurovascular uncoupling. However, hemodynamics could be modeled in the chronic phase, indicating chronic recoupling. Acute stroke also resulted in increased global brain oscillations, which showed distinct patterns in calcium and hemodynamics, and the increase in contralesional calcium activity was associated with increased functional connectivity. We also show that early return of responses, neurovascular recoupling, and global oscillations were predictors of improved behavioral outcomes.\nDownload full article"
