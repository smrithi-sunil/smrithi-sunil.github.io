## Relevant Experience

#### Scientist I
Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics <br />
*Allen Institute, Seattle, WA* <br />
November 2021 - Present

I develop and utilize imaging techniques to study the dynamics of neuromodulators and neurotransmitters across different brain regions during decision making behaviors in mice.

#### Graduate Student
BOAS Lab, Department of Biomedical Engineering <br />
*Boston University, Boston, MA* <br />
November 2017 - September 2021

I studied the longitudinal evolution of neurovascular coupling during stroke recovery in a mouse model of photothrombosis.

#### Graduate Student 
Ritt Lab, Department of Biomedical Engineering <br />
*Boston University, Boston, MA* <br />
December 2015 - October 2017

I used closed-loop real-time optogenetic feedback to understand the involvement of cortical sensory areas in active sensing motor outputs on short timescales.
