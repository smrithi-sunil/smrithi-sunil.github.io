It was about a year ago when I picked up a plane and started planing some scrap wood that Gavin had left lying around. He was just finishing up a tree bookshelf project and up until that time I had only mockingly paid attention to his woodworking. The tree bookshelf was his third project, having already completed a piano bench and a coffee table. The bookshelf was beautiful and my planing was the first step towards a potential life changing interest.

I was captivated with how satisfying it was to plane. A good stroke produced the most beautiful curl of woodshaving and all I wanted to do was produce another good stroke. I've always enjoyed working with my hands and building things. So far it was limited to building microscopes at work, which I enjoy and am good at. I had started a few different hobbies which involved working with my hands, like knitting, and very briefly, building ships in bottles. But none of that stuck. There was something different this time, about woodworking. 

It has been a little over a year since that introduction, and my interest in woodworking has only grown. I have also wanted to write more, so this is the start of my blog. It will start as a woodworking blog, but I hope to eventually write about other things too.
