## Abstract

**Significance:** Genetically encoded calcium ion (Ca^2+^) indicators (GECIs) are
powerful tools for monitoring intracellular Ca^2+^ concentration changes in living cells
and model organisms. In particular, GECIs have found particular utility for monitoring
the transient increase of Ca^2+^ concentration that is associated with the neuronal
action potential. However, the palette of highly optimized GECIs for imaging of neuronal
activity remains relatively limited. Expanding the selection of available GECIs
to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities
for in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity. In particular,
blue-shifted variants of GECIs are expected to have enhanced two-photon
brightness, which would facilitate multiphoton microscopy.

**Aim:** We describe the development and applications of T-GECO1 — a high-performance
blue-shifted GECI based on the Clavularia sp.-derived mTFP1.

**Approach:** We use protein engineering and extensive directed evolution to develop
T-GECO1. We characterize the purified protein and assess its performance in vitro
using one-photon excitation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, in vivo using onephoton
excitation fiber photometry in mice, and ex vivo using two-photon Ca^2+^
imaging in hippocampal slices.

**Results:** The Ca^2+^-bound state of T-GECO1 has an excitation peak maximum of
468 nm, an emission peak maximum of 500 nm, an extinction coefficient of
49,300 M^−1^ cm^−1^, a quantum yield of 0.83, and two-photon brightness approximately
double that of EGFP. The Ca^2+^-dependent fluorescence increase is 15-fold,
and the apparent K~d~ for Ca^2+^ is 82 nM. With two-photon excitation conditions at
850 nm, T-GECO1 consistently enabled the detection of action potentials with higher
signal-to-noise (SNR) than a late generation GCaMP variant.

**Conclusions:** T-GECO1 is a high-performance blue-shifted GECI that, under
two-photon excitation conditions, provides advantages relative to late generation
GCaMP variants.
