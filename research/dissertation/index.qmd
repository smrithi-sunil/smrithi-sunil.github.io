## Abstract

Functional neuroimaging, which measure vascular responses to brain activity, are
invaluable tools for monitoring and treating stroke patients both in the acute and chronic
phases of recovery. However, vascular responses after stroke are almost always altered
relative to vascular responses in healthy subjects and it is still unclear if these alterations
reflect the underlying brain physiology or if the alterations are purely due to vascular
injury. In other words, we do not know the effect of stroke on neurovascular coupling and
are therefore limited in our ability to use functional neuroimaging to accurately interpret
stroke pathophysiology. There is a need for animal models to investigate the effect of stroke
on neurovascular coupling to aid in better interpreting the results from functional
neuroimaging.

To that end, we first implemented a mouse photothrombotic stroke model that
mimics the physiology of a human stroke and therefore has high clinical relevance. Mice
were implanted with bilateral cranial windows to allow long term multimodal optical
access. The occlusion procedure was performed in awake animals while simultaneously
monitoring changes to cerebral blood flow. Our optimized photothrombotic stroke to the
somatosensory forelimb region produced a sustained behavioral deficit in the contralateral
forelimb that could be monitored longitudinally. Next, we implemented simultaneous
imaging of neuronal activity, through fluorescent calcium imaging, and hemodynamics,
through intrinsic optical signal imaging, to investigate neurovascular coupling during
stroke recovery. Additionally, we identified a novel use for spatial frequency domain
imaging to quantify the spatial extent of the stroke core.

Finally, we combined the mouse stroke model and imaging platforms to investigate
the effect of stroke on neurovascular coupling. We found that acute stroke led to the
abolishment of both calcium and hemodynamic responses to sensory stimulation. This
elimination of response was associated with a loss of correlation between calcium and
hemodynamic activity in the acute phase. To quantify neurovascular coupling, we modeled
spatiotemporal hemodynamics by convolving neural activity and hemodynamic response
functions obtained from deconvolution. Hemodynamic response functions from healthy
animals were unable to model hemodynamics in the acute phase, suggesting neurovascular
uncoupling. However, hemodynamics could be modeled in the chronic phase, indicating
chronic recoupling. Acute stroke also resulted in increased global brain oscillations, which
showed distinct patterns in calcium and hemodynamics, and the increase in contralesional
calcium activity was associated with increased functional connectivity. We also show that
early return of responses, neurovascular recoupling, and global oscillations were predictors
of improved behavioral outcomes.
