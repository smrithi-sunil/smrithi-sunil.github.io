Hi, I'm Smrithi! I'm a neuroscientist and biomedical engineer currently living in Madison, WI. I grew up in Bangalore, India, and moved to the United States for college. My work broadly focuses on developing microscopy techniques to study brain function. I am a research scientist in [Elizabeth Wright's lab](https://wrightlab.wisc.edu/), where I focus on advancing correlative light and electron microscopy to study cellular neurodegeneration.

My writing mostly lives on my Substack, [Engineering Discovery](https://www.engineering-discovery.com/), these days. Follow along there!

My interest in neuroscience began during my undergraduate studies at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, in [Jeffrey Capadona's lab](https://case.edu/bme/research/labs/capadona-lab). There, I researched the brain's response to implanted electrodes, focusing on improving the longevity of neural implants. I spent my summers and most of my non-class hours in a windowless basement lab, staining mouse brain slices and counting neurons.

I continued my research at Boston University, where I earned my PhD in Biomedical Engineering under [David Boas](https://sites.bu.edu/boas/). My [dissertation](images/Diss.pdf), “Wide-field optical imaging of neurovascular coupling during stroke recovery,” centered on developing a clinically relevant mouse stroke model and a multimodal imaging platform capable of simultaneously capturing neural activity and hemodynamic signals. I used this system to investigate the structural and functional reorganization of neurovascular circuits over time following stroke.

Following my PhD, I joined the Optical Physiology team at the [Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/allen-institute-neural-dynamics/) in Seattle. At the Allen Institute, I developed and applied a hyperspectral photometry system to study how neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine influence decision-making processes in mice.

Outside of research, I write about scientific progress and the process of discovery on my Substack, [Engineering Discovery](https://www.engineering-discovery.com/). My essay, *"A Brief History of GFP"* was published in [Asimov Press](https://press.asimov.com/articles/gfp). I also enjoy [woodworking](https://smrithisunil.com/woodworking.html), creating [interactive visuals](https://smrithisunil.com/posts/USA_testscores/), and [analyzing](https://smrithisunil.com/posts/IID_birthSize/) publicly available datasets.
